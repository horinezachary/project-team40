## Sprint 4
"Submarine", "Space Laser", and "Ship movement" were added to the game. The Submarine allows for a ship to be placed on the board either above water like the other ships or placed underwater, where it can be placed under ships and can only be attacked by the Space Laser. The Space Laser is unlocked after the first enemy ship is sunk, it allows you to attack underwater ships as well as the ship on top of it. Ship movement allows the user to input a direction and move all ships 1 unit over, this consumes a move.
